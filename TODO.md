* Write a parser for Drone that turns a digit into a Drone
* write a parser for NextActions that expects input like "[(1, Hover), (2, MoveIntercardinal NE)]"
* finish manualControl function for interactive control of an environment
* delete terminalNextActions function (should be renedered obsolete by parsers)
* finish updateState function so that everything seems to work properly under manualControl in tests
